#Name Split       

# Splits a full name string into its individual components (words) by spaces.

#This script iterates through each character in the input string `name`, building up words character by character.
#When a space character is encountered, the current word is added to the `parts` list and the word buffer is reset.
#After processing all characters, any remaining word is added to the list.
#Finally, the list of name parts is printed.

#Example:
    #Input:  "gordon andrew campbell"
    #Output: ['gordon', 'andrew', 'campbell']
